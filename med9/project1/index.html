<h1>The Tiger</h1>
<h2>The tiger is an exotic animal which is mostly known for its black stripes and orange fur. It's the largest living cat species as of today.</h2>
<h2>The tiger is an endangered animal, with only 3062-3948 of them living currently. The main reasons for their endangerment are habitat destruction and poaching.</h2>
<h2>The tiger has a strong body with a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. Their stripes are an advantage for camouflage in places like long grass fields with vertical lines of light and shadow.</h2>
<p>In the past, tigers lived across Asia but now they are known to live in only 13 countries. These are India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Russia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. India has 2,967 tigers which is over 70% of the global wild tiger population.</p>

	Tigers are mainly nocturnal predators. They generally hunt alone and kill their prey as most other cats do. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to leap onto its prey, knock it over, and grab the throat or bite with its teeth.

	The tiger has been one of the most hunted animals of Asia. Historically, tigers have been hunted so their famous striped skins could be collected. The trade in tiger skins was at its peak in the 1960s. By 1977, a tiger skin in an English market was worth $4250. Tiger parts are commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools.
